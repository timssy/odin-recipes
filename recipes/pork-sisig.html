        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Boiling the meat</strong>
                <p>
                    Put your pig ears, snout, pork belly, bay leaves, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 quart of water in a cooking pot. 
                    Apply some heat, and boil all of this for 1 hour. Then take the ingredients out, and drain your water.  
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Grilling the pig parts</strong>
                <p>
                    Now start heating up your grill. Put the meat you prepared earlier on the grill, and cook them for 5 minutes. 
                    Then turn them to the other side, and repeat the previous step. 
                    Transfer the cooked pig parts to a separate container, and let it cool down. 
                </p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Preparing the sisig dressing</strong>
                <p>
                    Combine all of these together in a bowl. Make sure to mix them thoroughly. 
                </p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tossing the meat and dressing together</strong>
                <p>
                    Now chop up the pig parts you grilled earlier. Get them in small pieces, and place these in a large mixing bowl. 
                    Pour in your dressing mixture. Then just toss everything together until they are all well-blended.
